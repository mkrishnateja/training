          a competent batsman is known as an all-rounder. Bowling the
          ball is distinguished from throwing the ball by a strictly

          In the sport of cricket, batting is the act or skill of hitting
          the cricket ball with a cricket bat to score runs or prevent the
          loss of one's wicket. A player who is currently batting is denoted
          as a batsman, while the act of hitting the ball is called a shot or
          stroke. The term specialist batsman is also used generically to
          describe players who specialise in batting and the term bowler is
          also used in this context.

          An all-rounder is a cricketer who regularly performs well at both
           batting and bowling. Although all bowlers must bat and quite a few
           batsmen do bowl occasionally, most players are skilled in only one
           of the two disciplines and are considered specialists. Some
           wicket-keepers have the skills of a specialist batsman and have been
           referred to as all-rounders.
